Last year, we shared a comprehensive financial report covering 2021-2023 for the first time. This initiative aimed to enhance transparency with our community, and we were pleased to hear that it was well received.

Continue with the same goal in mind, we are sharing the financial report for 2024.

GeeksBlaBla receives money from donations and sponsors, and our primary expenses are Tooling & Online Subscriptions, Team setup & support, and T-shirts & Delivery.

Here are the two types of sponsoring we have:

- Indirect sponsoring: mainly, the sponsoring company takes care of the expenses, and we do not take any money from them (hosting the event, paying for food, etc.).

- Direct sponsoring: The sponsor agrees to make a transaction of a specific amount in exchange for other benefits (designation as sponsor, booth for events, sessions, etc.).

This report covers only the direct sponsoring part.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals for 2025 & ðŸ’¡ Suggestions

As you may know, our primary sponsorship comes from our annual conference, BlablaConf. Unfortunately, we did not secure any sponsors for this year's edition. Therefore, we will focus on making sponsorships more appealing and developing sustainable sponsorship packages.
